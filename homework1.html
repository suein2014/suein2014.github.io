                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <hr>
                My name is Xiaoyan Tian.<br/>
                <br/>
                I graduated from a university as a CS
                student many years ago, then worked in an IT company coding with PHP
                for 4 years. <br/>
                However, I didn't work anymore since I moved to the US.
                It's already being a long time.<br/>
                <br/>
                About experience in web development, I only wrote some simple
                html-js-css  codes for a backstage management system for my team in
                a short time many years ago, and I learned these skills by myself,
                it's not systematically at all.

        <div class="reason">
          <span>
            The Reason why I take this class is, I hope to pick up my work again,
            so I applied a certification of Applied Python Programming at CSM last
            year. I am also interested in front-end skills very much, so I take this
              class.
