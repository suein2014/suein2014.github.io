<p>Try having the mouse over one of the paragraphs and see the color changing from red to blue in 2 seconds. The same happens if you click on the paragraph.</p>
<p>Another paragraph here for you to test.</p>
<p>This is a third paragraph for you to test one paragraph at a time.</p>
<p>What about inserting in the p:active property the a different font-size as well? What would happen to the paragraphs?</p>
